# Activity: User Stories

This activity will help you understand how to create and develop user stories in the requirements phase of software development.

## Instructions

**Step 1: Organize into teams (5 minutes)**

-   Divide into teams of 5.
-   Divide each team into the following two groups:
    -   2 users --- a generalist and a specialist.
    -   3 developers --- a database developer, a coder, and a user interface and experience designer.
-   Use a Google Doc (or something similar) to record your work.
    -   Designate a scribe.
    -   List the members of your team at the top of the document.
    -   Submit the URL to this document for your participation grade.

**Step 2: Define the scope of your project (5 minutes)**

-   Come up with a software project idea, for example an app.
-   Define the main purpose of the project.
    -   What is the value proposition?
    -   This is not a mission statement or vision statement.
    -   It's designed to allow you to accept or reject features and designs.

**Step 3: Elicit user stories (10 minutes)**

-   Write these on your document.

**Step 4: Convert user stories into requirements (10 minutes)**

-   Think of a requirement as a feature --- what the product will do.
-   Think of functional requirements as guides to actually develop code.
-   Create so-called non-functional requirements, too.

**Step 5: Prioritize requirements (10 minutes)**

-   Prioritize requirements by giving them a status of M, S, C, W.
-   Throw out everything but the Ms ðŸ˜„

**Step 6: Show and tell**

-   If there is time, each team will present its work.
-   To present, copy the URL to your document in the Teams chat for this course.
