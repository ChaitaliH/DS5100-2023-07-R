# Activity: User Stories 

This activity will help you understand how to create and develop user stories in the requirements phase of software development.

# Instruction

**Organize into teams of 5.**

Each team divide into two groups (5 min)

- 2 users -- generalist, specialist.
- 3 developers -- Data, Code, Interface.
- Use a Google Doc (or something similar) to record your work.
- Or, use another word process and designate a scribe.

Step 1: Define the scope of your project (5 minutes)

- What is main purpose of the project?
- What is the value proposition?
- Not a mission statement or vision.
- Designed to allow you to accept or reject features and designs.

Step 2: Elicit user stories (10 minutes)

- Write these on your document.

Step 3: Convert user stories into requirements (10 minutes)

- Think of a requirement as a feature â€“ what the product will do.
- Think of functional requirements as guides to actually develop code.
- Create so-called non-functional requirements, too. 

Step 4: Prioritize requirements (10 minutes)

- Prioritize requirements by giving them a status of M, S, C, W.
- Throw out everything but the Ms (smile)

Step 5: Show and tell
