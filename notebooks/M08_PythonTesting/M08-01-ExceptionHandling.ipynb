    "> All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\\n",
    "-- Leo Tolstoy, _Anna Karenina_, 1878.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that programs can succeed of fail:\n",
    "\n",
    "They can meet or not meet the motiving **requirements** for the code.\n",
    "  - Does it do what is is supposed to do?\n",
    "  - Does it add value to a process?\n",
    "  - Is it ethical? Does it do harm?\n",
    "\n",
    "They can **work or not work**:\n",
    "  - Does the run at all?\n",
    "  - Is the code brittle or buggy? \n",
    "  - Is it sensitive to contextual factors like bad user input or a bad database connection?\n",
    "  - Does the code work but produce incorrect outcomes?\n",
    "  \n",
    "These lead to **two practices**:\n",
    "* Strategic: **Project management**\n",
    "* Tactical: **Testing and debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will focus on some concepts and tools for the latter.\n",
    "* We want to know whether our code is **working or not**.\n",
    "* We want to know if our code is of a **high quality**.\n",
    "  \n",

    "**Approaches to quality**\n",
    "* Through good **design**\n",

    "## Tools and Concepts for Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages offer many tools for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These include mechanisms to define and capture errors in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call these errors **exceptions**.\n",
    "- An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We call we call dealing with these errors **exception handling**.\n",
    "- When a Python script encounters a code failure, it raises an exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python's Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exceptions**\n",
    "- A Python **object** that represents an error\n",
    "- Objects that classify kinds of errors\n",
    "- Coders can define these \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception Handlers**\n",
    "- Control structures and functions to deal with exceptions\n",
    "- `try`/`except`\n",

    "## Errors and Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "A common technical interview question: Explain the difference between an **error** and an **exception**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **error** is a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch.  \n",
    "An error will stop execution. It means the code if broken and needs to be rewritten.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exception** is an issue that is expected or known to occur (e.g., division by zero).  \n",
    "Software must handle exceptions. For example, one bad row of data shouldn't bring down the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Common Built-in Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a number of predefined exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries introduce new ones, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "They used in `raise` statement by the authors of programs when a possible error is anticipated.\n",

    "* The `try` block will contain a statement. \n",

    "An **excpetion** is a mistake that will halt the execution of code. \n",
    "* For example, trying to access a dictionary key that does not exit.\n",
    "* Or, a database connection fails. \n",
    "* Very often, execeptions are caused by an external dependency failing, such as another system or the user.\n",
